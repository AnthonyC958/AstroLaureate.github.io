# Research Interests

Samuel has been a key member of the OzDES and DES collaborations, utilising Type Ia supernova to constrain the properties
of dark energy in the universe. Shown below is a visualisation of the supernova observed by OzDES in the golden pencil beams,
where each point in the plot shows a separate galaxy.

His primary work with the Dark Energy Survey focuses on creating cosmological pipelines, to allow researchers to run
sophisticated analyses from raw data to cosmological constraints. The challenge with this is adequately tracking
sources of uncertainty in each stage of the pipeline, and ensuring that the uncertainty is propagated correctly.


In his other work, Samuel is a technical lead for the COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium, an international collaboration
of hospitals and academic institutions fighting COVID-19.

In his free time, Samuel studies the physics of tennis. His studies are rudimentary and rough.
